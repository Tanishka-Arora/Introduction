Hello there,My name is Tanishka Arora.

I am a data science fresher with a passion for solving complex problems using data-driven approaches.

Data is today's fuel.The sheer power of data drove me to initiate my journey into the world of Data Science.
Data Science has been my major point of interest for a year now. I find ease coding in Python,
but I never limit myself to learn Python just for Data Science.

I am currently in the 7th semester of my B.tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).
My current interests are (but not limited to)

-Data Analytics 
-Microsoft Excel
-Microsoft Power BI
-Python Development
-Mathematics and Statistics 

 Since I was young, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. So that's how I view data sets: as a single, complex puzzle that needs to be solved. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge for me. I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and programming.  I'm excited to leverage my skills to tackle real-world challenges.
